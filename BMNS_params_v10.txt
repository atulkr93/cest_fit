# Define fit parameter data, data names, base freqs,
#  initial parameter guesses, and paramter lower and upper bounds. 
#
# Add '+' to read in an additional set of parameters with given 'Name XYZ'
#   The 'Name' must match a .csv data file in given directory of the same name.
#
# Rows for parameters are as follows:
#  [Par name] [initial value] [lower bounds] [upper bounds] ([optional brute force number])
#
# If both lower and upper bounds are not given, they will be set to large values.
# '!' designates a fixed parameter that will not change throughout the fit.
# '*' designates a shared parameter that will be fitted for all data sets
#
# inhomo - spin lock inhomogeneity
# J - J coupling in Hz
# AlignMag - for CEST, controls the states whose magnetizations are summed up to calculate the intensity
# GS -> only GS magnetization is used (default)
# AVG -> sum of magnetization of all states is used
# ls - determine observed peak position using lineshape simulation (Y=yes, N=no). 
# default is no, as it is time consuming and generally, observed peak pos = GS
# resn - resolution for lineshape simulation to determine observed peak position. relevant only when ls=Y
# eqbn - allow equilibration (Y=yes, N=no)
# fitvar - fitting variable (I=intensity, V=volume)
# err_mode - mode of error estimation (STD = standard, MC=monte-carlo)
# mc_iter - number of monte carlo iterations. relevant only when err_mode=MC
# If only R1 and R2 are specified, these values are used for all states, assuming their relaxation 
# constants are equal 
# To include an extra relaxation variable in fitting, say R1c, just specify its bounds
# below the R2, in the list below 
# All combinations of unequal relaxation constants are handled
# inhomo - set to 0.0 for homogeneous spin-lock field
